Train of thought

Censorship of the female figure
* Censoring women's bodies on social media and other platforms implies that our bodies are inappropriate, and puts female nudity into the category of pornography. The decision to censor women's bodies is based on the male gaze and therefore stifles equality.

Meta's ‘Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity Community Standard’
“prohibits images containing female nipples, other than in specified circumstances, such as breastfeeding and gender confirmation surgery,” and is therefore based on a binary view of gender.

Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.

How to portray the theme:
* A series of distorted images based around the female form, which imitate the censorship.
