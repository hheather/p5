Train of thought

1. I particularly like this image: http://recodeproject.com/artwork/v1n4seated-nude
2. Reminds me of life drawing, could I use this and my life drawing sketches in some way?
3. Can also comment on how this is a hobby of mine?
    * Could mention how it's an activity I do with my friend who is also into drawing.
    * Maybe I can merge this with some sort of theme around friendships / female friendships ?
4. The female form as a piece of art
    * The female form can be described with a series of curves/arcs
5. Celebration of femininity, incorporating friendship in some way / sisterhood / womanhood, etc
