Train of thought

1. I could use my life drawing sketches in some way?
2. Why did I start going to life drawing?
    * Because it was an activity to do with my friend who is also into drawing.
3. Female friendships
4. The female form as a piece of art
5. Celebration of femininity, incorporating friendship in some way / sisterhood / womanhood, etc

The female form can be described with a series of curves.
